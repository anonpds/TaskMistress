Versions
========

0.1a:

  * support renaming tasks

0.1:

  * add support for moving tasks in the tree
  * additional keyboard controls for the tree view:
    - ENTER: add child
    - SHIFT+ENTER: add sibling
    - DEL: delete a task
  * update the meta data format to include variable names
    - requires a simple parser
  * add task tree meta data
    - save the tree creation time
    - save the tree format (filesystem)
    - save the default window size; MainWindow does this, so perhaps the
      meta data needs to be accessible from outside Store? 
  * add configuration option for selecting the default tree
  * write nodes out when they change; it's better to write them one at
    a time than all at once

0.0b: BROKEN

  * moved the task display code from MainWindow to new TaskView component
