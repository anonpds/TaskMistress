Versions
========

0.??:

  * added indexes for child tasks


0.1 Series
----------

0.1e: 13th April 2012

  * added status messages to status bar
  * added lock file to avoid opening same task tree twice

0.1d: 1st April 2012

  * fixed icon loading from Jar file
  * fixed Jar file generation in makefile
  * the configuration file path is created, if it doesn't exist
  * minor bug fixes
  * added task status (default, done, undone)

0.1c: 31st March 2012

  * removed old meta data format support
  * added custom icons for treeView
  * added status for tasks (no support for changing the status yet)

0.1b: 30th March 2012

  * changed keyboard controls, because they clashed with other controls
    - SPACE: add child
    - SHIFT+SPACE: add sibling
  * use UTF-8 for configuration files

0.1a: 30th March 2012

  * support renaming tasks

0.1: 30th March 2012

  * add support for moving tasks in the tree
  * additional keyboard controls for the tree view:
    - ENTER: add child
    - SHIFT+ENTER: add sibling
    - DEL: delete a task
  * update the meta data format to include variable names
    - requires a simple parser
  * add task tree meta data
    - save the tree creation time
    - save the tree format (filesystem)
    - save the default window size; MainWindow does this, so perhaps the
      meta data needs to be accessible from outside Store? 
  * add configuration option for selecting the default tree
  * write nodes out when they change; it's better to write them one at
    a time than all at once
