These icons are from the "Mini" icon-set at famfamfam.com with some changes:

  * default.gif: renamed page.gif
  * done.gif: renamed icon_accept.gif
  * undone.gif: renamed action_stop.gif
  * folder.gif: original
  * done-folder.gif: combined folder.gif and shrunk icon_accept.gif
  * undone-folder.gif: combined folder.gif and shrunk action_stop.gif

The original icons are "available for free use for any purpose" (source:
http://famfamfam.com/lab/icons/mini/) and the same applies to the changes
I have made to the original icons.
